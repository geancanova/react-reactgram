# ReactGram - A lightweight "Instagram like" exercise made with React
This is an Instagram-like project that I made to practice with the following technologies:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- React
- React Router
- React Redux

This project is an exercise from the course: [React do Zero a Maestria from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-do-zero-a-maestria-c-hooks-router-api-projetos).

## How to Run:
There are two folders (backend and frontend). 
- Run `npm install` inside each folder, then 
- Start the backend server with the  `npm run server` command line at the backend folder level
- Start the project with the `npm start` command line at the frontend folder level
